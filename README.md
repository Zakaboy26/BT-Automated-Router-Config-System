# BT-Automated-Router-Config-System
This project was developed in collaboration with BT Group as part of my final-year Software Engineering project. It automates the configuration of IoT routers used in critical infrastructure by validating user inputs and generating CSV outputs for BT’s automation pipeline, ensuring faster, error-free deployment.
